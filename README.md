# Enigma Encryption - Console
A console based simulation of the original Enigma machine

## 1: Rotor selection
You will be prompted to select a rotors (1 - 5) for the **right**, **middle** and **left** positions.

Note: once a rotor is selected, it cannot be placed in a different position.


## 2: Orientating the rotors
Once the three rotors have been selected, the starting orientation of each (1 - 26) will need to be selected.


## 3: Selecting the reflecter
The final step prior to encryption is the selection of the reflector (B or C)


## 4: Encryption
Once promted with:


      Cipher Started...


you can begin to input text, and upon hitting the enter key, the characters will be encrypted.

**Note**: special characters and any punctuation aside from a space will not be properly encrypted, though this will not brake the program.



# Decrypting
If you wish to decrypt any text you have previously simply:
1. Restart the program.
2. Select the same rotors used to encrypt the text in the same positions.
3. Orientate the rotors to the same positions.
4. Select the same reflector.
5. Finally, input the encrypted text and press enter, the output should be the decrypted message.
